# Getting Started with React Audio Recorder Hook

This guide will walk you through the basic setup and usage of the React Audio Recorder Hook in your application.

## Prerequisites

- A React application (v16.8.0 or higher for hooks support)
- Modern browser that supports the MediaRecorder API

## Installation

Install the package using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install react-audio-recorder-hook
# or
yarn add react-audio-recorder-hook
# or
pnpm add react-audio-recorder-hook
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the hook in a React component:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import useAudioRecorder from "react-audio-recorder-hook";

function AudioRecorderComponent() {
  const {
    startRecording,
    stopRecording,
    cancelRecording,
    pauseRecording,
    resumeRecording,
    playRecording,
    saveRecording,
    isRecording,
    isPaused,
    recordingDuration,
  } = useAudioRecorder({
    audioConstraints: { echoCancellation: true },
  });

  const handlePlay = async () => {
    const audioUrl = await playRecording();
    if (audioUrl) {
      const audio = new Audio(audioUrl);
      audio.play();
    }
  };

  const handleSave = async () => {
    const recording = await saveRecording();
    if (recording) {
      console.log("Recording saved:", recording.blob);
      // You can upload the blob or use it as needed
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        Recording: {isRecording ? "Yes" : "No"}
        {isPaused && " (Paused)"}
      </div>
      <div>Duration: {recordingDuration}s</div>

      <div>
        {!isRecording && (
          <button onClick={startRecording}>Start Recording</button>
        )}

        {isRecording && !isPaused && (
          <button onClick={pauseRecording}>Pause</button>
        )}

        {isRecording && isPaused && (
          <button onClick={resumeRecording}>Resume</button>
        )}

        {isRecording && <button onClick={stopRecording}>Stop</button>}

        {isRecording && <button onClick={cancelRecording}>Cancel</button>}

        <button onClick={handlePlay}>Play</button>
        <button onClick={handleSave}>Save</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Understanding the Basic Flow

1. **Initialize the hook**: Call `useAudioRecorder()` with optional configuration
2. **Start recording**: Call `startRecording()` when the user wants to begin recording
3. **Control recording**: Use `pauseRecording()`, `resumeRecording()`, or `cancelRecording()` as needed
4. **Finish recording**: Call `stopRecording()` when recording is complete
5. **Use the recording**: Call `playRecording()` to get a URL for playback or `saveRecording()` to get both the blob and URL
